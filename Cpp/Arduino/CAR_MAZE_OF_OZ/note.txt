setMotorLeft()
    Description: The function is used to controls the left motor speed and direction of rotation.
    Syntax: setMotorLeft(speed, direction)
    Parameters:
    speed: PWM value, from 0 to 255, to control the speed of the left motor.
    direction: 1 or 0, to control the direction of rotation of the left motor, with 1 being the value for setting the motor to go forward, 0 being the value for setting the motor to go backwards.
    Returns: Nothing.
setMotorRight()
    Description: The function is used to controls the right motor speed and direction of rotation.
    Syntax: setMotorRight(speed, direction)
    Parameters:
    speed: PWM value, from 0 to 255, to control the speed of the right motor.
    direction: 1 or 0, to control the direction of rotation of the right motor with 1 being the value for setting the motor to go forward, 0 being the value for setting the motor to go backwards.
    Returns: Nothing.
